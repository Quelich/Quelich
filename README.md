#                             Hi, I'm **Emre** 


- As a software engineer, I am responsible for designing and implementing sophisticated software tools(mobile, web) that enable IT infrastructure monitoring.
- My passion lies in backend development and system engineering, where I can apply my technical expertise to create efficient and reliable software systems.
- I thrive on the opportunity to **collaborate** with other team players, leveraging our collective skills and knowledge to tackle complex **challenges** and foster **continuous learning**.
- In my ongoing pursuit of excellence in software development, I devote a significant portion of my time to learning the latest best practices in **DevOps**.
- In addition to my professional work, I devote my spare time to developing video games, further honing my programming skills and creative problem-solving abilities.

I am currently developing Interlab. 
- Interlab is an IT infrastructure monitoring application backed by **Next.js** framework.
